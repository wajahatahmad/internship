Password Complexity Checker

A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords based on various criteria. The goal of such a tool is to help users create robust passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, thereby enhancing their overall security online. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how a Password Complexity Checker works and the benefits it provides.
How it works:

1.Length:

    Minimum Length: The password should be at least 8 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure, so additional points might be awarded for passwords that are 12 characters or longer.

2.Character Variety:

    Uppercase Letters: Presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
    Lowercase Letters: Presence of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
    Numbers: Inclusion of at least one numeric digit (0-9).
    Special Characters: Use of special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), etc.).

3.Overall Composition:

    The combination and variety of these characters increase the password's complexity, making it harder for malicious actors to guess or brute-force the password.
